      Hi! My name is Victoria Paines, I am 19 years old and a fresher at Christ’s College Cambridge.
      I was brought up in a family which is very charity-oriented. I first got involved with the refugee crisis in Calais through protests about the Dubs amendment. I have worked alongside HelpRefugees with whom I organised a transfer of clothes donations from England and the redistribution of baby formula from the male-dominated camps in Calais to women’s refuges in London. Following this, I spent a month working in the Calais / Dunkirk area with Care4Calais, with the volunteers who have since set up Mobile Refugee Support, and assisting in distributions with Refugee Community Kitchen, as well as coming into contact with many of the charities listed here.
      As a fresh-faced 18-year-old I felt very daunted by the seeming range of volunteering opportunities but also by the confusion that resulted from the destruction of the Calais and Grande-Synthe camps last year. There were so many listed charities and it was hard to ascertain exactly what each did, in what area, and whether they were still operating despite the lack of donations and volunteers caused by Western media’s growing disinterest with this humanitarian crisis at Europe’s heart.
      I had a wonderful experience volunteering and it fundamentally changed me, my outlook, and made ma a much kinder, wiser, and more resourceful individual. Therefore, this website aims at making it easier for others to pursue their aim and actually make it to Calais, thereby raising awareness, keeping pressure on local, national, and international bodies, and raising the quality of life of the refugees on the ground.
      This website aims to make it easier to compare charities and make the right choice on an individual and skills-based level.
      Happy volunteering and remember! The world needs more VoluntHeres!
