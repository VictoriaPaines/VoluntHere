<h3 b>Who are they?</h3>
<p>
"Our aim is to feed where food is needed, to build where we can build and to give our support to the volunteers on the ground.
Since the 1st of December 2015 we’ve served over a million meals. Showing up rain or shine, and doing everything we can to make sure that no one goes hungry.
At present, people are living rough, without basic facilities or support of any kind in northern France, Paris and other camps throughout Europe.
RCK is a communal effort. It’s people helping people and we could not do what we do with out the support of many generous donors and volunteers.
We are looking for kitchen volunteers, cooks and chefs are needed to keep the quality and quantity going but anyone can contribute to the huge amount of chopping, prepping, washing and serving we do every day."
</p>

<br clear="all" />

<h3 b>What would volunteering with them involve?</h3>
<p>
Working in the industrial kitchen which they built in the L'auberge des Migrants warehouse.
<ul>
  <li>
    Meal preparation, e.g. washing and cooking rice.
  </li>
  <li>
    Maintaining hygiene and cleanliness in the kitchen, e.g. washing up.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a long-term volunteer once can expect to distribute food.
  </li>
  <li>
    Driving
  </li>
  <li>
    Sorting stock.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>

<br clear="all" />

<h3 b>How are they different to other charities?</h3>
<p>
  Exclusively food-related. This is fascinating as you learn about the food of each culture and you are aware that you are providing crucial sustenance and links to their culture. However, it does mean that, depending on the length of time for which you volunteer, you could end up never actually meeting a refugee, instead only working in the kitchen.
</p>


<br clear="all" />

<h3 b>Accommodation offered?</h3>
<p>
  Yes – accommodation in caravans in Calais near the wharehouse with other volunteers.
</p>

<br clear="all" />

<h3 b>Particular skills they look for?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Previous kitchen experience.
  </li>
  <li>
    Valid driving license.
  </li>
  <li>
    Long-term volunteers, as these are the people who distribute in the camp.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 b>Testimonials:</h3></h3>
<p>
  <div class="well well-lg">"This group could not be more amazing. I have volunteered with them multiple times in the past year and a half and whilst the situation gets worse and worse in Calais, they keep going. Always true to their mission of serving hot, healthy, nutritious food with love, RCK is full of superstar humans who are dedicated to doing what they can for refugees in a truly inhumane situation in Calais...with a smile, a kind word and some truly delicious meals. From the amazing long-term volunteers to weekend warriors, everyone is united in their dedication to choosing love. Please, please, please volunteer or do a fundraiser or just donate to this incredible organisation. #chooselove"</div>
